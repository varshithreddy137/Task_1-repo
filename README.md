# Task_1 
Working on Task 1 was truly a great learning experience for me. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me an opportunity to explore and understand new concepts that I might not have encountered otherwise. One of the biggest takeaways from this task was learning how to approach problems independently. Whenever I came across a concept I didn't know—especially in C programming—I didn’t just skip it or give up. Instead, I took it as a challenge to research, read, and understand how things actually work behind the scenes. This process not only improved my technical skills but also made me more confident in my ability to figure things out on my own.

Challenges Faced
One of the major challenges I faced during this task was my lack of familiarity with certain programming languages and commands. There were moments where I felt stuck and unsure of how to proceed. But instead of depending entirely on AI tools, I made a conscious effort to limit my usage and focus more on self-learning. I did use AI occasionally, but only to understand the logic or the structure of certain solutions. It felt incredibly rewarding to learn something new and then apply it successfully in solving a problem.

My Approach
I began the task by attempting the Light Dose questions, thinking they would be simple. But to my surprise, they required a deeper understanding than I initially expected. I had to spend several days just learning and practicing Linux commands and understanding the logic behind them. The resources provided were very helpful, and I made the most of them to build my foundation.

Once I completed the Light Dose, I moved on to the Medium Dose questions. These were definitely more challenging, requiring me to think critically and deeply understand the problem statements. Despite the difficulty, I enjoyed working on them. Every time I successfully solved one, it gave me a real sense of accomplishment.

Finally, I attempted a Hard Dose question. I was only able to solve one, but that one question gave me more satisfaction than all the others combined. It made me realize that even if a problem seems difficult, with the right mindset and effort, I can tackle it. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to solve the other hard dose questions, mainly because I’m not familiar with Python yet. One of the questions also left me completely blank—I couldn’t figure out where to even start. That’s when I decided: I will start learning Python soon. I believe it will open up many more opportunities for me in programming.

Resources Used
Throughout this task, my main resource was Google Search. I relied on it heavily to look up unfamiliar concepts, understand syntax, and read about how different commands and programs work. It helped me discover new websites, forums, and articles that enriched my understanding. It’s amazing how much you can learn just by being curious and willing to dig deeper.



Thank you, MaRS Team!
Looking forward to learning more!
