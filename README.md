# Task_1 
It was a great learning experience working on this task. I learned so much, especially by figuring out how to do certain things on my own. If I didn’t know something, especially in C, I tried to understand how it works and why it works that way. Overall, the experience of completing Task 1 was very fulfilling.

#Challenges Faced:

I struggled with some programming concepts and didn't know certain things, which led me to research and learn about them. I limited myself from using AI too much, but used it occasionally to understand concepts better. It felt great to learn something new through that process.

#Approach:

I started with the Light Dose questions, assuming they would be easy—but I quickly realized they weren’t as simple as I thought. I learned most of the Linux commands from the given links, and this part actually took me the most time.

Next, I worked on the Medium Dose questions. These were a bit difficult, but I felt very happy after solving them. They weren’t extremely hard, but required a lot of thinking and understanding of the questions.

Finally, I attempted a Hard Dose question. I was only able to do one, but it gave me a great sense of accomplishment. I couldn’t do the rest because I don’t know Python yet, and for one of the questions, I couldn’t figure out the logic. I’m planning to learn Python soon—I believe it will help me a lot.

#Resources Used:

I mostly used Google Search to understand new things and concepts. It really helped me learn a lot.

Thank you, MaRS Team!
Looking forward to learning more!
